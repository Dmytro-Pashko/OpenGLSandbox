# Overview:
Hi, I am an Android developer who has developed a desire to learn the basics of computer graphics (specifically using [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/)). 

Starting from the first 3D engines (Id Tech 1, Quake Engine) and going to modern such as Unreal Engine 4, Unity, CryEngine, Source, they have pivotal basic technologies and concepts of computer graphics. Actually, understanding how it works under the hood will allow us to work with any type of engine and take control over all parts of rendering process.

Actually, I want to share the obtained knowledge with everyone who also wants to work with 3D graphics or the OpenGL too. Moreover, this repository is useful to understand the LibGDX API.

I've faced with the [LibGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) after searching a cross-platform tool for convenient working with computer graphics which provides simple API to interact with GPU. In fact, the most required things for me was the ability to create the cross-platform 3D application(Windows, Android, iOS) using OpenGL API.

Briefly, the LibGDX is a Java cross-platform framework that released its first version in 2009. It comes with an OpenGL ES 2.0 and 3.0 wrapper interface, which is the one that lets us perform 3D development.
Also, the LibGDX offers convenient classes to avoid a lot of boilerplate code,  the all LibGDX features described [here](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/features.html).

In this repository, I'm using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) since it allows us to reduce the amount of boilerplate code that we need to write in Java.
# Research:
Currently, I've made a few articles in order to describe the general things in graphic programming like vertex data creation, transformations, coordinate system, projection view, texturing, and shaders. These are essential things to build the powerful 3D applications.

We will use some math (linear algebra, geometry, and trigonometry) along with the articles, we can't avoid it :). Don't worry, I will try to explain all the required concepts of math.

I can assume that you familiar with Java or Kotlin and have installed the LibGDX, Java Development Kit (JDK) 
otherwise, a simple Google search will do it :)

This research is divided into the following chapters:
* [Part 1 - The OpenGL introduction and first scene](https://github.com/Dmytro-Pashko/OpenGLSandbox/blob/chapter_1/README.md).

In each chapter, I'm trying to implement everything on my own for a better understanding of all concepts, because doing things by yourself is really fun and exciting and gives you a great understanding of the process.

**Note:**
*To simplify some things I've used a LibGDX API. But, it doesn't affect the understanding of the basic OpenGL functionality and most of the rendering parts were implemented by myself.*
